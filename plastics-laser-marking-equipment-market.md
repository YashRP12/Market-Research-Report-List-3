<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastics Laser Marking Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CO2 Type</li><li>Solid State Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plastics laser marking equipment market can be classified into two main types: CO2 type and solid-state type. CO2 type lasers use a gas mixture to produce a high-energy beam suitable for marking on plastics. On the other hand, solid-state lasers use a solid material like crystal or glass to generate the laser beam. Both types offer high precision and speed in marking plastics, but solid-state lasers are typically more durable and have longer lifespans. The choice between the two types depends on specific application requirements and budget considerations.</p></p>
