<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Grade LiDAR Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Lidar</li><li>Solid State Lidar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Grade LiDAR scanners can be divided into two main types: Mechanical LiDAR and Solid State LiDAR. Mechanical LiDAR systems use moving parts to scan their surroundings, providing high-resolution images but with the potential for mechanical wear and tear over time. Solid State LiDAR, on the other hand, is a newer technology that eliminates moving parts, making it more durable and reliable. While Mechanical LiDAR systems are currently more common in the market, Solid State LiDAR is gaining popularity due to its advanced technology and improved performance.</p></p>
