<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Superabsorbent Dressing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adherent</li><li>Non-Adherent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Superabsorbent dressings come in two main types - adherent and non-adherent. Adherent dressings adhere to the wound bed, preventing the dressing from sticking to the wound and causing trauma upon removal. Non-adherent dressings have a protective layer that does not adhere to the wound, making removal less painful and reducing the risk of disrupting the healing process. Both types are designed to absorb exudate and maintain a moist wound environment for optimal healing.</p></p>
