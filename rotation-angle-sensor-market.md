<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotation Angle Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushless Sensor</li><li>Brushed Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotation angle sensors are essential components in various industries to measure the rotational position of a shaft or object. There are two main types of rotation angle sensors: brushless sensors and brushed sensors. Brushless sensors use magnetic fields to detect the rotation angle without physical contact, making them more reliable and durable. On the other hand, brushed sensors rely on physical contact between the sensor and the rotating object, making them more affordable but less accurate and less reliable compared to brushless sensors.</p></p>
