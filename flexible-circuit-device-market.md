<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Circuit Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Sided</li><li>Double-Sided</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flexible circuit devices are classified into two main types: single-sided and double-sided circuits. Single-sided circuits consist of a single layer of flexible substrate with conductive traces on one side only. They are suitable for simple electronic applications. Double-sided circuits, on the other hand, have conductive traces on both sides of the flexible substrate, allowing for more complex and compact designs. These circuits are ideal for applications with higher component density and interconnectivity requirements.</p></p>
