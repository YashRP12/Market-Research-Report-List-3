<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Ignitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact-controlled Ignition System</li><li>Breakless Ignition System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Contact-controlled Ignition System is a traditional type of automotive ignitor where a physical contact, typically a set of points, regulates the timing of the spark in the combustion chamber. On the other hand, Breakless Ignition System is a more advanced technology that does not rely on physical contacts. Instead, it uses sensors to detect the position of the engine's components and triggers the spark electronically. Breakless ignition systems are more reliable and have better timing accuracy compared to contact-controlled systems.</p></p>
