<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Melt Flow Index Test Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Melt Flow Rate Test</li><li>Melt Volume Rate Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Melt Flow Index (MFI) test measures the flowability of a plastic resin. In the Melt Flow Rate (MFR) test, a standard weight of resin is melted and the time it takes to flow through a small opening is recorded. This test is used mainly for high-flow-grade materials. On the other hand, the Melt Volume Rate (MVR) test measures the volume of resin that flows through the same opening in a given time, typically used for low-flow-grade materials. These tests help determine the viscosity of plastic resins and are vital in quality control for various industries.</p></p>
