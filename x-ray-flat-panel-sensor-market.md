<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-Ray Flat Panel Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Type</li><li>Direct Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The X-Ray Flat Panel Sensor market can be categorized into two main types: Indirect Type and Direct Type. Indirect Type sensors use scintillator materials to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then captured by a photosensitive array. Direct Type sensors, on the other hand, directly convert X-rays into electronic signals through an amorphous silicon or selenium layer. Indirect Type sensors are generally more cost-effective, while Direct Type sensors offer higher image quality and resolution.</p></p>
