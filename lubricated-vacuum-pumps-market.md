<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lubricated Vacuum Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Multi Stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lubricated vacuum pumps come in two main types: single stage and multi stage pumps. Single stage pumps operate with a single rotor and stator arrangement, making them ideal for general-purpose applications with a moderate vacuum level requirement. On the other hand, multi stage pumps have multiple rotor-stator arrangements, allowing them to achieve higher vacuum levels compared to single stage pumps. Multi stage pumps are commonly used in industries that require a strong vacuum, such as semiconductor manufacturing and chemical processing.</p></p>
