<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mattifying Primer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Base</li><li>Silicone-Base</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mattifying primers are available in two main types: water-based and silicone-based. Water-based primers are lightweight and usually preferred by those with oily or acne-prone skin as they do not clog pores. They provide a matte finish without feeling heavy on the skin. On the other hand, silicone-based primers create a smooth canvas for makeup application, filling in pores and fine lines. They are ideal for those with dry or normal skin looking for a flawless finish. Both types offer long-lasting oil control and help makeup stay put throughout the day.</p></p>
