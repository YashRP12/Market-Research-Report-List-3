<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small-Scale Liquefaction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Liquefaction</li><li>Indirect Liquefaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small-scale liquefaction refers to the process of converting natural gas into liquefied natural gas (LNG) at a smaller scale compared to traditional large-scale liquefaction plants. Direct liquefaction is a market type where natural gas is converted into LNG through a direct cooling process, typically involving the use of cryogenic temperatures. On the other hand, indirect liquefaction involves the conversion of natural gas into a synthetic gas (syngas) or natural gas liquids (NGLs) through a series of chemical processes, which are then further cooled and condensed into LNG. Both types play a significant role in enabling the transportation and storage of natural gas.</p></p>
