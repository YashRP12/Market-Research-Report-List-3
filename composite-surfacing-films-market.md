<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Surfacing Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Processing</li><li>Out-Of-Autoclave Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite surfacing films are used in two main types of markets - Autoclave Processing and Out-Of-Autoclave Processing. In Autoclave Processing, the composite materials are cured under high pressure and temperature inside an autoclave, ensuring uniform distribution of heat and pressure for a strong, durable finish. On the other hand, in Out-Of-Autoclave Processing, the curing process takes place outside the autoclave, using alternative methods such as vacuum infusion or oven curing. Both markets cater to different manufacturing processes and requirements.</p></p>
